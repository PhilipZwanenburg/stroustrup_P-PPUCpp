# Learning C++

This project contains sample solutions to the drills (and some exercises) of the 2nd edition (2014) of [Programming - Principles and Practice Using C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html) by Bjarne Stroustrup.

## Running the codes

Compile the codes using the Makefiles in the 'drills' and 'exercises' directories after modifying the src directory path.
